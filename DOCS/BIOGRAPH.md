Visualization of the biological system from the YAML format, we can use `graphviz`, a popular Python library for creating visual representations of graphs and networks.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Install `graphviz` and `PyYAML`**:
    Ensure you have `graphviz` and `PyYAML` installed.
    ```sh
    pip install graphviz PyYAML
    ```

2. **Update `biocomp.py` to Include Visualization**:
    Let's update the script to include a function to generate and visualize the graph based on the parsed YAML data.


### Explanations
1. **`graphviz` import**: The addition of the `graphviz` module is necessary for graph visualization.
2. **Function `visualize_biological_system`**: This function takes a `BiologicalSystem` object and creates a directed graph of the system.
   - It adds nodes for each molecule and logic gate.
   - It adds edges to represent inputs and outputs for each logic gate.
3. **Update `main` function**: After running the simulation, it calls `visualize_biological_system`.

### Running the Visualization

To test this updated version and visualize the biological system, run the script withTo test this updated version and visualize the biological system, run the script with the desired YAML configuration file. For example:

```sh
python biocomp.py 1/biocomp.yaml
```

### Example Output

If you use `1/biocomp.yaml`, the output visualization will represent the biological system with the components and connections specified.

#### Expected Command Line Output

```plaintext
Running simulation for BioCompSystem1
Conditions: {'time': 100, 'temperature': 37}
Expected Outputs: ['Protein OutputProt']
```

#### Visualization

Upon running this, the `graphviz` library will generate a PNG file named `bio_system_graph.png` and open it, displaying the graphical representation of the biological system. The visualization will typically look like this:

```
 Input1Prot (Protein)  Input2Prot (Protein)
         \                 /
          \               /
          AND Gate
              |
          OutputProt (Protein)
```

### Additional Example

Similarly, if you run:

```sh
python biocomp.py 4/biocomp.yaml
```

You should see:

```plaintext
Running simulation for BioCompSystem4
Conditions: {'time': 120, 'temperature': 37}
Expected Outputs: ['Protein OutputProt']
```

And a visualization representing a NOT gate:

```
Input1Prot (Protein)
        |
     NOT Gate
        |
OutputProt (Protein)
```

### Notes

- Ensure that you have Graphviz installed on your system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it using:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install graphviz
  ```

  On macOS, you can install it using Homebrew:

  ```sh
  brew install graphviz
  ```

  For Windows, you can download the installer from the Graphviz website and add Graphviz to your PATH.

- Ensure that your Python environment is properly set up to find the Graphviz executables. If the generated `PNG` file doesn't open automatically, you can find it in your working directory and open it manually.

By following these steps, you should be able to visualize different configurations of biological systems defined in YAML files. This will help in understanding and debugging the structure and flow of your biological simulations.
